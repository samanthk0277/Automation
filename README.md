2. TestMaxWordAndLength - junit test case is created to test the verifyLengthAndLongestWord method with various combinations
of the following inputs

i. With expected word and its length
ii. Null word and length
iii. Expected max word and length as null

Note: Run @Test method - verifyLengthAndLongestWord from Arithmatic class from TestNG suite xml since I have used return value for
